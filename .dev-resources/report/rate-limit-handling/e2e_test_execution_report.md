## Features Tested

This comprehensive end-to-end test validates the recently implemented **Rate Limit Handling and Exponential Backoff** features:

### Primary Features:
1. **Exponential Backoff Retry Logic** - Automatic retry with intelligent delays
2. **Rate Limit Detection and Handling** - Graceful handling of HTTP 429 responses  
3. **Defensive Programming Fixes** - Prevention of NoneType attribute errors
4. **Error Classification and User-Friendly Messages** - Intelligent error responses
5. **Complete Integration Pipeline** - FastAPI → OpenRouter → MCP Server flow

## Conclusion

The rate limit handling and exponential backoff implementation has been comprehensively tested through end-to-end scenarios. 

**Overall Assessment:** ⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION

Some tests failed. Review the failure analysis report for detailed remediation guidance.

## Next Steps

- Review failure analysis report
- Consider additional load testing for production traffic patterns
- Monitor OpenRouter API usage and rate limit patterns in production
- Implement logging dashboard for retry behavior monitoring
