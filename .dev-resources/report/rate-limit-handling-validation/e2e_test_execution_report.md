**Success Rate:** 100.0%

## Features Tested

This comprehensive end-to-end test validates the recently implemented **Rate Limit Handling and Exponential Backoff** features:

### Primary Features:
1. **Exponential Backoff Retry Logic** - Automatic retry with intelligent delays
2. **Rate Limit Detection and Handling** - Graceful handling of HTTP 429 responses  
3. **Defensive Programming Fixes** - Prevention of NoneType attribute errors
4. **Variable Scope Bug Fixes** - Resolution of variable naming conflicts in stress testing
5. **Complete Integration Pipeline** - FastAPI → OpenRouter → MCP Server flow
