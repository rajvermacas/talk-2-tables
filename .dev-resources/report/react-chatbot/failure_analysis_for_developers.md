**Role**: End-to-End Tester (Analysis Only - No Code Modifications)

## Critical Developer Action Items

This document provides detailed root cause analysis for test failures discovered during E2E testing. All failures require developer investigation and code remediation.


## Failure 1: Server Startup and Health Checks

### Error Details
**Error Message**: MCP server failed to start
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T13:26:22.312635

### Root Cause Analysis
MCP server startup failure - check database path, port availability, or dependencies

### Impact Assessment
**Severity**: Critical
**Impact**: Critical - entire system depends on MCP server

### Developer Investigation Areas

- Check server startup logs in respective log files
- Verify port availability (8000, 8001, 3000)
- Validate environment configuration files (.env)
- Test database connectivity independently
- Check OpenRouter API key validity

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Reproduce the issue in development environment
2. Add debugging logs to identify exact failure point
3. Create unit tests for the failing component
4. Implement fix and validate with integration tests
5. Re-run E2E test suite to confirm resolution

## Failure 2: FastAPI Connection Status

### Error Details
**Error Message**: Connection status test failed: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /mcp/status (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fc71ca03fb0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T13:26:23.314787

### Root Cause Analysis
API communication error: ConnectionError

### Impact Assessment
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Cannot verify system connectivity status

### Developer Investigation Areas

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Reproduce the issue in development environment
2. Add debugging logs to identify exact failure point
3. Create unit tests for the failing component
4. Implement fix and validate with integration tests
5. Re-run E2E test suite to confirm resolution

## Failure 3: Natural Language Chat

### Error Details
**Error Message**: Natural language chat test failed: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /chat/completions (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fc71ca28470>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T13:26:24.316815

### Root Cause Analysis
Chat API error: ConnectionError - possible network timeout, API key issue, or server overload

### Impact Assessment
**Severity**: High
**Impact**: Core chat functionality unavailable

### Developer Investigation Areas

- Verify OpenRouter API key and quota
- Check FastAPI chat completion endpoint implementation
- Test MCP client connection to MCP server
- Validate request/response data models
- Review error handling in chat processing pipeline

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Reproduce the issue in development environment
2. Add debugging logs to identify exact failure point
3. Create unit tests for the failing component
4. Implement fix and validate with integration tests
5. Re-run E2E test suite to confirm resolution

## Failure 4: Direct SQL Query Processing

### Error Details
**Error Message**: SQL query test failed: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /chat/completions (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fc71ca03d40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T13:26:25.318658

### Root Cause Analysis
SQL processing error: ConnectionError

### Impact Assessment
**Severity**: High
**Impact**: Direct SQL functionality unavailable

### Developer Investigation Areas

- Test database schema and sample data
- Verify MCP server query execution functionality
- Check SQL parsing and validation logic
- Test database permissions and connection string
- Review query result formatting

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Reproduce the issue in development environment
2. Add debugging logs to identify exact failure point
3. Create unit tests for the failing component
4. Implement fix and validate with integration tests
5. Re-run E2E test suite to confirm resolution

## Failure 5: Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Details
**Error Message**: Error handling test failed: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /chat/completions (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fc71ca03f20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T13:26:26.320455

### Root Cause Analysis
Error handling test error: ConnectionError

### Impact Assessment
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Cannot verify error handling robustness

### Developer Investigation Areas

- Review input validation in FastAPI endpoints
- Check error handling middleware
- Test exception handling in chat processing
- Verify HTTP status code mapping
- Review API error response formatting

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Reproduce the issue in development environment
2. Add debugging logs to identify exact failure point
3. Create unit tests for the failing component
4. Implement fix and validate with integration tests
5. Re-run E2E test suite to confirm resolution

## Failure 6: Performance Metrics

### Error Details
**Error Message**: No successful performance test queries
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T13:26:27.324210

### Root Cause Analysis
All performance test queries failed - system performance cannot be measured

### Impact Assessment
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Performance characteristics unknown

### Developer Investigation Areas

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Reproduce the issue in development environment
2. Add debugging logs to identify exact failure point
3. Create unit tests for the failing component
4. Implement fix and validate with integration tests
5. Re-run E2E test suite to confirm resolution
