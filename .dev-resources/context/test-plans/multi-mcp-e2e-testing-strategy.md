## System Architecture Overview

### Components Under Test
```
User Query → React Frontend (localhost:3000) 
    ↓
FastAPI Backend (localhost:8001) 
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Multi-MCP Orchestration           │
├─────────────┬───────────────────────┤
│ Database MCP    │ Product MCP       │
│ localhost:8000  │ localhost:8002    │
│ (SQLite data)   │ (Metadata)        │
│ SSE transport   │ SSE transport     │
└─────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

### Key Business Rules
1. **Priority Rule**: Product metadata MCP takes precedence over Database MCP for overlapping data
2. **Synchronous Behavior**: FastAPI waits for both MCP responses before returning results
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System should handle individual MCP failures gracefully
4. **Data Consistency**: Product IDs must be consistent across both MCPs

---

## Testing Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Validate Multi-MCP Communication**: Ensure FastAPI correctly orchestrates both MCPs
- **Test Priority Rule Enforcement**: Verify Product MCP data overrides Database MCP conflicts
- **Verify Cross-Reference Functionality**: Confirm data correlation between MCPs works correctly
- **Validate Error Handling**: Test system behavior when one or both MCPs fail
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure acceptable response times for multi-MCP queries

### Test Scope
- ✅ **In Scope**: E2E user workflow, MCP communication, data consistency, error handling
- ❌ **Out of Scope**: Individual MCP server unit tests, database schema validation, authentication

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Start all required services (3 terminals)
# Terminal 1: Database MCP Server
python -m talk_2_tables_mcp.remote_server

# Terminal 2: Product MCP Server  
TRANSPORT=sse python scripts/start_product_server.py --port 8002

# Terminal 3: FastAPI Backend
uvicorn fastapi_server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Terminal 4: React Frontend
cd react-chatbot && npm start
```

### Service Health Checks
```bash
# Verify all services are running
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # FastAPI Backend
curl http://localhost:3000         # React Frontend (should return HTML)

# SSE endpoints (should timeout - means they're streaming)
curl http://localhost:8000/sse     # Database MCP
curl http://localhost:8002/sse     # Product MCP
```

## Puppeteer MCP Tool Usage

### Important Note
**NO SEPARATE PUPPETEER SCRIPTS NEEDED** - We will use the Puppeteer MCP tool directly through Claude Code's built-in integration. This eliminates the need to write and maintain separate test automation scripts.

### Direct Tool Usage Examples

#### Navigation and Setup
```
# Navigate to frontend
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate(url="http://localhost:3000")

# Take baseline screenshot
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_screenshot(name="baseline-system")
```

#### Test Execution
```
# Submit a query
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_fill(selector="#query-input", value="Show me iPhone sales")
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_click(selector="#send-button")

# Wait and evaluate response
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_evaluate(script="""
  const responseElement = document.querySelector('.response-content');
  return responseElement ? responseElement.textContent : null;
""")

# Take result screenshot
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_screenshot(name="test-result-iphone-sales")
```

#### Validation
```
# Check for error messages
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_evaluate(script="""
  const errorElement = document.querySelector('.error-message');
  return errorElement ? errorElement.textContent : null;
""")

# Verify loading indicators
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_evaluate(script="""
  const loadingElement = document.querySelector('.loading-indicator');
  return loadingElement ? 'Loading' : 'Complete';
""")
```

### Test Flow Using Puppeteer MCP Tool

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Navigate to frontend URL
   - Take baseline screenshot
   - Verify UI elements are present

2. **Test Execution Phase**
   - Fill query input field
   - Click submit button
   - Wait for response
   - Extract response data

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Evaluate response content
   - Check for errors
   - Verify data structure
   - Take result screenshot

4. **Cleanup Phase**

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Service Startup Issues
```bash
# Check port availability
netstat -tulpn | grep -E "8000|8001|8002|3000"

# Restart services if needed
pkill -f "mcp"
./start-all-services.sh

# Verify MCP health
curl http://localhost:8000/sse  # Should timeout (streaming)
curl http://localhost:8002/sse  # Should timeout (streaming)
```

### Puppeteer MCP Tool Issues
- Ensure browser is launched with proper options

- Verify page has loaded before interactions
- Use appropriate timeouts for async operations

### Data Consistency Issues
```bash
# Reset test data
python scripts/setup_test_db.py
python scripts/setup_product_catalog.py

# Verify product IDs match
cat test_data/products.json | jq '.[] | .product_id'
```
