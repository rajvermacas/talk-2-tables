## Session 19 - 2025-08-16 12:21 IST
**Focus Area**: Production-ready startup script system for managing all Talk2Tables servers with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and process management.

### Key Accomplishments
- **Complete Startup System**: Created comprehensive Python-based startup script system managing all 4 servers with proper process control, logging, and monitoring.
- **Main Startup Orchestrator**: Implemented `scripts/start_all_servers.py` (644 lines) with process management, health monitoring, real-time status dashboard, and graceful shutdown.
- **Emergency Stop Script**: Created `scripts/stop_all_servers.sh` with force kill capabilities using multiple cleanup methods (lsof, pgrep, port-based killing).
- **Health Check Utility**: Developed `scripts/check_server_status.py` (391 lines) with HTTP health checks, process monitoring, watch mode, and JSON output.
- **Validation Framework**: Built comprehensive test suite `scripts/test_startup_script.py` for system validation and health checking.
- **Documentation Complete**: Created `scripts/README_STARTUP.md` with comprehensive usage instructions and troubleshooting guide.

### Technical Implementation
- **Server Configuration Management**: 
  - **MCP Database Server** (Port 8000): `python3 -m talk_2_tables_mcp.server --transport sse`
  - **Product Metadata Server** (Port 8002): `python -m talk_2_tables_mcp.product_metadata_server --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0`
  - **FastAPI Backend** (Port 8001): `python3 -m fastapi_server.main`
  - **React Frontend** (Port 3000): `cd react-chatbot && npm start`
- **Process Management Features**:
  - Individual subprocess management with monitoring
  - Port availability checking before startup
  - Virtual environment validation
  - Signal handling for graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)
  - Auto-restart capabilities (configurable)
- **Logging Infrastructure**:
  - Individual log files per server in `logs/` directory
  - Rotating file handlers (10MB max, 5 backups)
  - Color-coded console output for easy monitoring
  - Combined system log with comprehensive error capture
- **Health Monitoring System**:
  - HTTP endpoint checking for server health
  - Process and port monitoring
  - Real-time status dashboard with color coding
  - Watch mode with auto-refresh capabilities
  - JSON output for automation integration

### Startup Script Architecture
- **ServerConfig Class**: Configuration objects for each server with name, command, port, working directory, health URL, and startup delay
- **ServerManager Class**: Main orchestrator handling process lifecycle, logging setup, health monitoring, and status display
- **Multi-threading Design**: Separate threads for monitoring and status display to prevent blocking
