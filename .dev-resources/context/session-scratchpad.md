#### Problem Diagnosis Process
1. **Transport Issue Investigation**: Initially suspected transport protocol mismatch (HTTP vs SSE)
2. **Error Log Analysis**: Identified specific validation and attribute errors in MCP client
3. **SDK Compatibility**: Discovered MCP SDK returns `AnyUrl` objects that need string conversion
4. **Attribute Mapping**: Found that ReadResourceResult uses `contents` (plural) not `content`

#### Current State After This Session
