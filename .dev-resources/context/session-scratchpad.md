## Previous Session (Session 22 - 2025-08-16 22:01 IST)
**Focus Area**: Multi-MCP Health Check Fix & Routing Logic Investigation - Successfully resolved health monitoring issues but identified core routing logic problems preventing Product MCP server utilization.

### Key Accomplishments
- **Health Check Architecture Fix**: Resolved critical health monitoring issue where Multi-MCP Platform expected REST `/health` endpoints but MCP servers are protocol-based
- **MCP Connectivity Testing**: Implemented proper health checks using actual MCP protocol connectivity instead of REST endpoint simulation
- **Multi-MCP Platform Status**: Achieved 100% server health reporting (both Database and Product MCP servers)
- **Root Cause Identification**: Discovered core routing logic issue - intent detection not using YAML routing rules for product queries
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Confirmed all components operational but routing logic fundamentally broken

### Technical Implementation
- **Health Check Logic Fix** (`fastapi_server/server_registry.py`):
  - Replaced random simulation with actual MCP connectivity testing via HTTP JSON-RPC calls
  - Added proper timeout handling, connection error detection, and health status management
  - Implemented transport-specific health checking (streamable-http vs SSE protocols)
- **Product MCP Server Updates** (`src/talk_2_tables_mcp/product_metadata_server.py`):
  - Added Starlette health endpoint registration (unnecessary but harmless)
  - Ensured proper SSE transport configuration matching YAML config
- **Multi-MCP Platform Monitoring**:
  - Verified server registry reporting: `"healthy_servers": 2, "health_percentage": 100.0`
  - Confirmed operation coverage: `["execute_query", "lookup_product", "search_products"]`

### Critical Discovery: Routing Logic Broken
**Problem Identified**: Despite 100% healthy infrastructure, intent detection and routing logic is not functional:
```bash
# Query that should route to Product MCP server
curl "http://localhost:8001/v2/chat" -d '{"query": "What is QuantumFlux DataProcessor?"}'

# Results in:
{
  "metadata": {
    "intent_classification": "conversation",     # Should be "product_lookup" 
    "servers_used": [],                         # Should include "product_metadata"
    "detection_method": "semantic_cache_hit"    # Should use routing rules
  }
}
```

**Root Cause**: Intent detection logic not using YAML routing rules. Pattern matching like `"what is {product}"` ‚Üí Product MCP server is non-functional. All queries default to semantic cache or database server only.

### Testing Evidence
- **‚úÖ Infrastructure Health**: Multi-MCP Platform operational with both servers healthy
- **‚úÖ Product MCP Server**: 26 products loaded including QuantumFlux DataProcessor test data
- **‚úÖ Routing Rules Configured**: YAML patterns properly defined (`"what is {product}"` ‚Üí `product_metadata`)
- **‚ùå Intent Classification**: Pattern matching logic not recognizing product queries
- **‚ùå Server Utilization**: Product MCP server never called despite being healthy and operational

### Files Modified
1. **`fastapi_server/server_registry.py`**: Updated `check_server_health()` method to use actual MCP connectivity testing instead of random simulation
2. **`src/talk_2_tables_mcp/product_metadata_server.py`**: Added health endpoint support (unnecessary but applied)
3. **`.dev-resources/context/multi-mcp-routing-fix-session-summary.md`**: Created comprehensive fix documentation for next session

### Current State After This Session
- **Health Monitoring**: ‚úÖ 100% operational - both Database and Product MCP servers report healthy
- **Multi-MCP Platform**: ‚úÖ All infrastructure components working correctly
- **Intent Detection**: ‚ùå Core routing logic broken - not using YAML routing rules

## Current Session (Session 23 - 2025-08-16)
**Focus Area**: LLM-Based Routing Fix - Removed brittle pattern matching in favor of pure LLM-driven intent detection

### Changes Made
1. **Removed Pattern Matching** (`fastapi_server/multi_server_intent_detector.py`):
   - Disabled YAML routing rule pattern matching (was never working properly)
   - Removed hardcoded regex patterns for product detection
   - Now relies entirely on LLM for intelligent routing (except explicit SQL)

2. **Enhanced LLM Prompt** (`fastapi_server/multi_server_intent_detector.py`):
   - Updated system prompt with explicit routing instructions
   - Added clear examples for product queries
   - Specified when to use each server type

### Issue Still Persists
Despite removing pattern matching and enhancing the LLM prompt, product queries are still misclassified:
- "What is QuantumFlux DataProcessor?" ‚Üí classified as "conversation" instead of "product_lookup"
- The Gemini LLM is not properly understanding the routing instructions
- Product MCP server resources are NOT being accessed

### Root Cause
The LLM-based routing is fundamentally not working because:
1. The LLM doesn't understand what constitutes a "product" query
2. The server capabilities context might not be properly formatted
3. The semantic cache interferes with fresh classifications

## File Status
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-16 (Session 23)
- **Session Count**: 23
- **Project Phase**: üîÑ **LLM ROUTING ATTEMPTED - STILL NOT WORKING**

---

## Evolution Notes
The project has evolved from a simple MCP server to a complete Universal Data Access Platform with enterprise-grade process management. The AsyncIO compatibility fix represents a critical production readiness milestone, ensuring all async components initialize properly within the FastAPI event loop context. This enables reliable deployment of the semantic caching and enhanced intent detection systems.

## Session Handoff Context
üîÑ **HEALTH MONITORING FIXED - ROUTING LOGIC NEEDS REPAIR**. Talk 2 Tables Multi-MCP Platform has operational infrastructure but critical routing logic issues preventing Product MCP server utilization:

### Critical Fix Completed (Session 22)
- ‚úÖ **Health Check Architecture**: Fixed Multi-MCP Platform to use actual MCP protocol connectivity instead of REST endpoints
- ‚úÖ **100% Server Health**: Both Database and Product MCP servers now report healthy with proper monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Operational**: All components working correctly with comprehensive server registry
- ‚ùå **Intent Detection Broken**: Core routing logic not using YAML routing rules for product queries

### Root Cause Identified
**Problem**: Intent detection logic is fundamentally broken - pattern matching from YAML routing rules is non-functional:
- Queries like `"What is QuantumFlux DataProcessor?"` should match `"what is {product}"` pattern ‚Üí Product MCP server
- Instead: All queries default to semantic cache hits or database server routing only
- Pattern matching logic in intent detection system is not using the routing configuration

**Evidence**: 
```bash
# Expected: "intent_classification": "product_lookup", "servers_used": ["product_metadata"]
# Actual: "intent_classification": "conversation", "servers_used": []
```

**Current Status**: üîÑ **INFRASTRUCTURE READY - ROUTING LOGIC REPAIR NEEDED**. The platform provides:
- **100% Healthy Infrastructure**: Both Database (port 8000) and Product MCP (port 8002) servers operational
- **Product MCP Ready**: 26 products loaded including QuantumFlux DataProcessor test data
- **Routing Rules Configured**: YAML patterns properly defined but not being used by intent detection
- **Multi-MCP Platform**: All server registry, orchestration, and health monitoring working correctly

**Next Session Priority**: 
1. **Debug Intent Detection Logic**: Investigate why pattern matching from YAML routing rules is not functional
2. **Fix Routing Implementation**: Ensure `"what is {product}"` patterns properly route to Product MCP server
3. **Validate Product Queries**: Test QuantumFlux DataProcessor returns detailed metadata from Product MCP
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Confirm complete Multi-MCP coordination with hybrid queries

**Key Files to Investigate**: 
- `fastapi_server/mcp_platform.py` - Platform orchestration
- `fastapi_server/multi_server_intent_detector.py` - Intent classification logic  
- `fastapi_server/enhanced_intent_detector.py` - Enhanced detection system

**Success Criteria**: Product queries return detailed metadata from Product MCP server instead of generic LLM responses.
