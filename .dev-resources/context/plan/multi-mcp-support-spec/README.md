# Multi-MCP Support - Specification-Driven Development

## Overview

This directory contains **specification-driven development** plans for implementing multi-MCP support in the Talk 2 Tables system. Unlike traditional implementation plans, these specifications focus on **WHAT** must be built rather than **HOW** to build it.

## Specification Principles

1. **Concise**: Each phase spec is 1-2 pages maximum
2. **Behavioral**: Define system behavior, not implementation details
3. **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria for validation
4. **Standalone**: Each phase spec is self-contained

## Phase Specifications

### Phase 01: Foundation (~95% Complete)
**File**: `phases/phase-01-foundation-spec.md`
- Multi-MCP infrastructure establishment
- Product Metadata MCP server
- Orchestrator with registry and cache
- **Status**: Implementation nearly complete, documentation remaining

### Phase 02: Intelligent Routing (Not Started)
**File**: `phases/phase-02-intelligent-routing-spec.md`
- Query enhancement with metadata
- Product alias resolution
- Column mapping application
- LLM prompt enrichment

### Phase 03: Advanced Features (Not Started)
**File**: `phases/phase-03-advanced-features-spec.md`
- SQL error recovery strategies
- Query optimization
- Graceful degradation
- Retry logic with backoff

### Phase 04: Production Ready (Not Started)
**File**: `phases/phase-04-production-ready-spec.md`
- Health monitoring
- Prometheus metrics
- Horizontal scaling
- Zero-downtime updates

## How to Use These Specifications

### For Developers
1. Read the phase spec before starting implementation
2. Focus on meeting acceptance criteria
3. Use contracts as interface definitions
4. Validate against behavior specifications

### For Reviewers
1. Check implementation against acceptance criteria
2. Verify all MUST requirements are met
3. Ensure MUST NOT constraints are respected
4. Validate behaviors match specifications

### For Testers
1. Create test cases from behavior specifications
2. Verify acceptance criteria programmatically
3. Test constraint boundaries
4. Validate contract compliance

## Key Differences from Implementation Plans

| Aspect | Implementation Plan | Specification |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Focus | How to build | What to build |
| Length | Detailed (10+ pages) | Concise (1-2 pages) |
| Content | Code examples, patterns | Requirements, behaviors |
| Audience | Developers | All stakeholders |
| Purpose | Guide implementation | Define success |

## Success Metrics

The multi-MCP support is considered complete when:

1. **Foundation**: All MCP servers connect and provide resources
2. **Routing**: Queries leverage metadata for >20% improvement
3. **Recovery**: 80% of SQL errors auto-corrected
4. **Production**: 99.9% uptime with full monitoring
