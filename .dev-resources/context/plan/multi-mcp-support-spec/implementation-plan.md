# Multi-MCP Support Implementation Plan (Specification-Driven)

## Requirements Overview

Transform Talk 2 Tables from single-MCP to multi-MCP architecture, enabling intelligent query routing across specialized metadata services for enhanced natural language to SQL conversion.

## High-Level Architecture

### System Components
- **MCP Orchestrator**: Central hub managing multiple MCP connections
- **Service Registry**: Priority-based server discovery and selection  
- **Resource Cache**: Performance optimization through intelligent caching
- **Query Router**: LLM-powered routing with metadata awareness
- **Error Recovery**: Self-healing SQL generation with retry logic

### Data Flow
```
Natural Language → Resource Aggregation → Enhanced LLM Prompt → SQL Generation
                        ↑                                           ↓
                  Multiple MCPs                              Error Recovery
```

## Phase Dependencies

Linear progression with clear handoffs:
- **Phase 01** → Foundation (95% complete)
- **Phase 02** → Intelligent Routing (requires Phase 01)
- **Phase 03** → Advanced Features (requires Phase 02)
- **Phase 04** → Production Ready (requires all previous)

Each phase delivers working functionality that subsequent phases build upon.
