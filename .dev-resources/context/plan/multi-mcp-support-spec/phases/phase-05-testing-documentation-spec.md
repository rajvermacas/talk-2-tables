# Phase 5: Testing & Documentation Specification

## Purpose
Ensure system reliability through comprehensive testing and provide clear documentation for operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- All integration tests passing
- E2E test covers multi-MCP scenarios
- Documentation updated with multi-MCP setup
- Deployment guide includes new components

## Dependencies
- Phases 1-4 completed
- Test infrastructure (pytest)

## Requirements

### MUST
- Test each component in isolation
- Test multi-MCP coordination
- Test failure scenarios
- Document configuration options
- Provide troubleshooting guide

### MUST NOT
- Use production data in tests
- Require external services for unit tests
- Leave debug code in production

## Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests
```
- Product metadata server resource loading
- Orchestrator connection management
- Resource caching logic
- LLM prompt generation
- SQL retry logic
```

### Integration Tests
```
- Multi-MCP connection establishment
- Resource gathering from multiple servers
- Priority-based resolution
- Cache expiration and refresh
- Failure recovery
```

### E2E Tests
```
Test: Product alias resolution
Input: "sales for abracadabra"
Verify: Query executes with resolved product_id

Test: Multi-MCP coordination
Input: Complex query requiring metadata
Verify: All MCPs contribute to solution

Test: Graceful degradation
Setup: One MCP unavailable
Verify: System continues with available MCPs
```
