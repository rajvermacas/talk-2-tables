# Phase 03: Advanced Features - Error Recovery & Optimization Specification

## Purpose
Add SQL error recovery, query optimization, and advanced caching strategies to improve system reliability and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- SQL errors automatically corrected in 80% of cases
- Failed queries retry with enriched context (max 3 attempts)
- Query performance improves by 30% via optimizations
- System handles MCP server failures gracefully
- Error patterns logged for continuous improvement

## Dependencies
- Phase 02 completed (intelligent routing operational)
- Database error messages accessible
- LLM capable of SQL correction

## Requirements

### MUST
- Categorize SQL errors (syntax, schema, permission, data)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Provide detailed error messages to LLM for correction
- Track error patterns for analysis
- Support graceful degradation when MCPs unavailable

### MUST NOT
- Retry destructive operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Exceed 3 retry attempts per query
- Cache failed query results

### Key Business Rules
- Syntax errors get immediate retry with correction
- Schema errors trigger metadata refresh before retry
- Permission errors fail immediately (no retry)
- Each retry includes previous error context

## Contracts

### Error Recovery Request
```python
@dataclass
class ErrorRecoveryRequest:
    failed_sql: str
    error_message: str
    error_type: ErrorCategory
    attempt_number: int
    original_query: str
    mcp_resources: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Recovery Strategy Interface
```python
class RecoveryStrategy(ABC):
    async def can_handle(error: Exception) -> bool
    async def recover(request: ErrorRecoveryRequest) -> str
```

## Behaviors

**Syntax Error Recovery**
```
Given SQL with syntax error "SELECT * FORM users"
When error recovery triggered
Then corrected SQL "SELECT * FROM users" is generated
And query succeeds on retry
```

**Schema Error Recovery**
```
Given SQL referencing non-existent column
When error includes "column 'xyz' does not exist"
Then LLM receives full schema information
And generates SQL with correct column names
```

**Graceful Degradation**
```
Given Product Metadata MCP is unavailable
When query processing occurs
Then system continues with Database MCP only
And logs degraded operation mode
```

## Constraints
- **Performance**: Error recovery < 5 seconds total
- **Reliability**: No infinite retry loops
- **Security**: No sensitive data in error logs

## Deliverables
- `fastapi_server/error_recovery.py` - Recovery strategies
- `fastapi_server/retry_manager.py` - Retry logic with backoff
- `fastapi_server/query_optimizer.py` - SQL optimization rules
- Integration tests for error scenarios
