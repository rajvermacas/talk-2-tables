# Multi-MCP Routing Fix Session Summary

**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Session Focus**: Debugging and fixing Multi-MCP Platform routing issues  
**Status**: Infrastructure Fixed, Routing Logic Issue Identified  

## Critical Findings

### ✅ Successfully Fixed: Health Check Infrastructure 
**Original Problem**: Product MCP server was reporting as "unhealthy" in Multi-MCP Platform monitoring.

**Root Cause Discovery**: The Multi-MCP Platform was expecting REST `/health` endpoints, but MCP servers are protocol-based, not REST-based.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Updated Health Check Logic** (`fastapi_server/server_registry.py`):
   - Replaced random simulation with actual MCP connectivity testing
   - Implemented proper HTTP-based MCP endpoint testing for `streamable-http` transport
   - Added timeout and error handling for health checks

2. **Current Status**: Both servers now report 100% healthy
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/platform/status
   # Shows: "healthy_servers": 2, "health_percentage": 100.0
   ```

### ❌ Primary Issue Identified: Intent Detection/Routing Logic is Broken

**Current Behavior**: Multi-MCP Platform infrastructure is operational but not routing queries correctly.

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Test query that should route to Product MCP server
curl -s "http://localhost:8001/v2/chat" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "query": "What is QuantumFlux DataProcessor?",
  "user_id": "test_user"
}' | jq .

# Result shows:
{
  "metadata": {
    "intent_classification": "conversation",     # Should be "product_lookup"
    "servers_used": [],                         # Should include "product_metadata"
    "detection_method": "semantic_cache_hit"    # Should route to Product MCP
  }
}
```

**Pattern Matching Not Working**: Even explicit queries like "product QuantumFlux DataProcessor" (which should match the `product {product}` pattern) are misclassified as database queries.

## Current System Status

### ✅ Infrastructure Components - All Operational
| Component | Status | Port | Transport | Health |
|-----------|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Database MCP Server** | ✅ Running | 8000 | SSE | Healthy |
| **Product MCP Server** | ✅ Running | 8002 | SSE | Healthy |
| **FastAPI Backend** | ✅ Running | 8001 | HTTP | Healthy |
| **Multi-MCP Platform** | ✅ Running | N/A | N/A | 100% Health |

### ✅ Test Data - Properly Loaded
**Product MCP Server** contains custom test products:
- **QuantumFlux DataProcessor** (ID: 99001) - Should return detailed metadata
- **HyperScale Analytics Suite** (ID: 99002) - Secondary test product
- **26 total products** loaded successfully

**Database MCP Server** contains corresponding sales data:
- QuantumFlux sales records with product_id `quantumflux-001`
- Ready for hybrid queries testing

### ✅ Configuration Files - Properly Defined

**Routing Rules** (`config/mcp_servers.yaml`):
```yaml
routing_rules:
  product_queries:
    patterns:
      - "what is {product}"          # Should match "What is QuantumFlux DataProcessor?"
      - "tell me about {product}"
      - "product {product}"          # Should match "product QuantumFlux DataProcessor"
    required_servers: ["product_metadata"]
    intent_type: "product_lookup"
```

**Server Configuration** working correctly:
```yaml
servers:
  - server_id: "product_metadata"
    url: "http://localhost:8002"
    transport: "sse"
    capabilities: ["product_lookup", "search_products", "get_product_categories"]
```

## Code Analysis - Where the Issue Lies

### ✅ Frontend - Correctly Updated
**React Frontend** (`react-chatbot/src/hooks/useChat.ts`):
- ✅ Calls `apiService.sendPlatformQuery()` 
- ✅ Uses `/v2/chat` Multi-MCP Platform endpoint
- ✅ Proper request format with `query` field

### ✅ Multi-MCP Platform API - Working
**FastAPI Backend** (`fastapi_server/main.py`):
- ✅ `/v2/chat` endpoint functional
- ✅ Accepts proper request format: `{"query": "...", "user_id": "..."}`
- ✅ Returns structured responses with metadata

### ❌ Intent Detection Logic - BROKEN
**Suspected Issue Location**: The intent detection and routing implementation is not using the YAML routing rules.

**Key Files to Investigate**:
1. `fastapi_server/mcp_platform.py` - Main platform orchestration
2. `fastapi_server/multi_server_intent_detector.py` - Intent classification logic
3. `fastapi_server/enhanced_intent_detector.py` - Enhanced detection system
4. `fastapi_server/server_registry.py` - Server routing decisions

**Current Behavior**: 
- All queries default to either semantic cache hits or database routing
- Pattern matching from YAML routing rules is not being applied
- Intent classification logic is overriding the routing rules

## Next Session Action Plan

### Priority 1: Debug Intent Detection Logic
1. **Trace Intent Detection Flow**:
   - Add debug logging to intent detection methods
   - Verify YAML routing rules are being loaded and parsed
   - Check if pattern matching logic is functional

2. **Test Pattern Matching**:
   - Verify regex/pattern matching against "what is {product}" pattern
   - Test if `QuantumFlux DataProcessor` is being extracted as `{product}` variable
   - Ensure product name normalization works correctly

3. **Check Multi-MCP Platform Initialization**:
   - Verify routing rules are loaded during platform startup
   - Check if server registry is properly mapping capabilities to operations
   - Ensure intent detector has access to routing configuration

### Priority 2: Validate Product MCP Integration
1. **Direct Product MCP Testing**:
   - Test Product MCP server directly with proper session management
   - Verify QuantumFlux DataProcessor exists in product catalog
   - Confirm product lookup tools are functioning

2. **Platform-Level Integration**:
   - Force routing to Product MCP server bypassing intent detection
   - Test if Multi-MCP Platform can successfully call Product MCP tools
   - Verify response handling and error propagation

### Priority 3: End-to-End Validation
1. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Test with restarted React development server
   - Validate queries route through corrected backend
   - Verify product metadata appears in responses

2. **Hybrid Query Testing**:
   - Test queries requiring both Product MCP + Database MCP
   - Validate execution order and data aggregation
   - Ensure sales analysis works with product resolution

## Debugging Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check current system status
curl http://localhost:8001/platform/status | jq .
curl http://localhost:8001/servers | jq .

# Test direct Multi-MCP Platform routing
curl -s "http://localhost:8001/v2/chat" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "query": "What is QuantumFlux DataProcessor?",
  "user_id": "debug_user"
}' | jq .

# Check server health and connectivity
curl http://localhost:8000/  # Database MCP (should show MCP endpoint)
curl http://localhost:8002/  # Product MCP (should show MCP endpoint)

# Process status
ps aux | grep uvicorn  # FastAPI servers
ps aux | grep python  # MCP servers
```

## Key Success Metrics

When the fix is working correctly, the following should be observed:

1. **Intent Classification**: 
   ```json
   {
     "intent_classification": "product_lookup",
     "servers_used": ["product_metadata"],
     "detection_method": "routing_rules_match"
   }
   ```

2. **Product Response**:
   - Detailed QuantumFlux DataProcessor metadata from Product MCP
   - Not generic LLM-generated response
   - Rich product information including business context

3. **Multi-Server Coordination**:
   - Hybrid queries use both Product MCP and Database MCP
   - Proper execution order maintained
   - Results aggregated correctly

## Files Modified This Session

1. `fastapi_server/server_registry.py` - Updated health check logic to use MCP connectivity
2. `src/talk_2_tables_mcp/product_metadata_server.py` - Added health endpoint (unnecessary but harmless)

## Startup Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Terminal 1: Database MCP Server
python -m talk_2_tables_mcp.remote_server

# Terminal 2: Product MCP Server  
TRANSPORT=sse python scripts/start_product_server.py

# Terminal 3: FastAPI Backend
uvicorn fastapi_server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

# Terminal 4: React Frontend
cd react-chatbot && npm start
```

**Critical Note**: The Product MCP server must use `TRANSPORT=sse` to match the configuration in `config/mcp_servers.yaml`.

## Confidence Level

- **Infrastructure Fix**: 100% - Health monitoring now works correctly
- **Issue Identification**: 95% - Intent detection/routing logic is definitely the problem
- **Solution Complexity**: Medium - Likely requires debugging pattern matching and intent classification logic, not major architectural changes

The Multi-MCP Platform architecture is sound and all components are operational. The fix should be straightforward once the intent detection logic is corrected to properly use the routing rules configuration.
